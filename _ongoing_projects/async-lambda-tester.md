Test generation for JavaScript API functions with asynchronous callback arguments.
This is building off of previous work [LambdaTester](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3276531), which was a test generator for higher-order JavaScript functions -- we are extending this to work with asynchronous callbacks.

### Current status
Working on the evaluation, and planning to submit a paper soon.
