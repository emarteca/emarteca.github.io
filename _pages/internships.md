I've done a few internships during my PhD, all of which resulted in some cool open-source work!

### Google -- Summer 2022 

I was a software engineering intern with the Android Rust (Android Security) team at Google, where I worked on extending <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a></span> with C FFI support.

This project is an ongoing open source project! 
Check out the full design doc, which describes the changes to Miri (and corresponding additions to the Rust compiler).
The design doc has <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://hackmd.io/eFY7Jyl6QGeGKQlJvBp6pw?view#Relevant-links"><a list of links to PRs></a></span>.

### Amazon Web Services -- Summer 2021 

I was an applied science intern with the Automated Reasoning Group at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS (Amazon)</a></span>.
There I built a dataflow framework for SMT queries in Rust, which is also open sourced: <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/rust-smt-ir-examples/tree/main/amzn-smt-string-transformer>awslabs/rust-smt-ir-examples/amzn-smt-string-transformer</a></span>.

### GitHub (Semmle) -- Summer 2019

I was a research engineer intern with <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://semmle.com/">GitHub (Semmle)</a></span>, working on the JavaScript analysis package of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/">CodeQL</a></span> language.
This internship resulted in <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://emarteca.github.io/publications/tse22.pdf/"><a cool research paper></a></span> -- the code and experiments replication package is also <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/emarteca/JSEventAPIModelling"><open sourced></a></span>.
