# Ellen Arteca
<span style="color:gray">arteca.e [at] northeastern [dot] edu</span>

&nbsp;

I'm a PhD student at Northeastern University, where I'm a part of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Programming Languages lab</a></span> working with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.franktip.org/">Frank Tip</a></span>. 
My PhD work has been focused on program analysis (mostly static) of JavaScript for optimization/refactoring/test generation.
I've also recently started working on a tool for automatic analysis of <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a></span> packages.
<!-- , with the end goal of a large-scale study on the state of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a></span> ecosystem. -->


In summer 2019 I was a reseach engineering intern at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://semmle.com/">GitHub (Semmle)</a></span>, where I was working on the JavaScript analysis package of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/">CodeQL</a></span> language.

Prior to this, I did my masters at the University of Waterloo in the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">Programming Languages group</a></span>, where I worked with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="http://the.gregor.institute/">Gregor Richards</a></span> on a technique for fast gradual typing using the virtual machine.
My undergraduate was at Laurentian University, where my research was in computational ecology, in fruit fly population modelling (there was a time where I didn't work on programming languages!).
