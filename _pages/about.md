# Ellen Arteca

&nbsp;

During the year, I'm a PhD candidate at Northeastern University, where I'm a part of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Programming Languages lab</a></span> working with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.franktip.org/">Frank Tip</a></span>. 
For my PhD thesis work, I've been applying program analysis to large codebases, and amalgamating the results of these analyses to learn more than can be inferred from a single program.
This is particularly relevant to JavaScript, a highly dynamic language with features that limits what can be learned with traditional program analysis.
I've worked on inferring bug patterns in event listener registrations and object property accesses, and on building/seeding feedback-directed test generators for JavaScript.
I've also built <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/emarteca/npm-filter/">a tool</a></span> for automating the mining of dynamic metadata in <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a></span> packages.
<!-- , with the end goal of a large-scale study on the state of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a></span> ecosystem. -->

This past summer 2021 I was an applied science intern with the Automated Reasoning Group at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Amazon</a></span>, where I worked on a dataflow framework for SMT queries in Rust, so we could generate equisatisfiable queries with all string literals anonymized. 
This project is open sourced! 
Check it out at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/rust-smt-ir/tree/main/amzn-smt-string-transformer">awslabs/rust-smt-ir/amzn-smt-string-transformer</a></span>.

In summer 2019 I was a reseach engineering intern at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://semmle.com/">GitHub (Semmle)</a></span>, where I was working on the JavaScript analysis package of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/">CodeQL</a></span> language.

Prior to this, I did my masters at the University of Waterloo in the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">Programming Languages group</a></span>, where I worked with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="http://the.gregor.institute/">Gregor Richards</a></span> on a technique for fast gradual typing using the virtual machine.
My undergraduate was at Laurentian University, where my research was in computational ecology, in fruit fly population modelling (there was a time where I didn't work on programming languages!).
