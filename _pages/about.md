# Ellen Arteca
<span style="color:gray">arteca.e [at] northeastern [dot] edu</span>

&nbsp;
I'm a software engineer on the Android Security Rust team at Google.

&nbsp;

I recently got my PhD from Northeastern University, working with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.franktip.org/">Frank Tip</a></span>. 
My <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:4f214s21k/fulltext.pdf">PhD thesis</a></span> research was on program analysis of JavaScript.
Mainly, I was working around the limitations on what we can infer from a single program in such a dynamic language by applying program analysis to large codebases, and amalgamating the results of these analyses to learn patterns (both bugs and correct API usages).
My favourite projects I built as part of my research are 
* <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/emarteca/nessie/">a feedback- and mined-data-directed test generator</a></span> for JavaScript, and
* <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/emarteca/npm-filter/">a tool</a></span> for automating the mining of dynamic metadata in <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a></span> packages.
<!-- , with the end goal of a large-scale study on the state of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a></span> ecosystem. -->

Prior to this, I did my masters at the University of Waterloo in the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">Programming Languages group</a></span>, where I worked with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="http://the.gregor.institute/">Gregor Richards</a></span> on a technique for fast gradual typing using the virtual machine.
My undergraduate was at Laurentian University, where my research was in computational ecology, in fruit fly population modelling (there was a time where I didn't work on programming languages!).

Feel free to email and say hi!
