I am currently a reseach engineering intern at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://semmle.com/">Semmle</a></span>, where I am working on the JavaScript analysis package of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/Semmle/ql/">QL</a></span> language.

During the year, I'm a PhD student at Northeastern University where I'm a part of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Programming Languages lab</a></span> working with <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.franktip.org/">Frank Tip</a></span>. 
My PhD work so far is focusing on static analysis of asynchronous JavaScript code.

Prior to this, I did my masters at the University of Waterloo in the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">Programming Languages group</a></span>, doing research on gradual typing working with <span style="color:blue"><a href="http://the.gregor.institute/">Gregor Richards</a></span>.
My undergraduate was at Laurentian University, where my research was in computational ecology, in fruit fly population modelling (so, not programming languages!).

Feel free to email me.
