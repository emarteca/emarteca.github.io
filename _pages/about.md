&nbsp;

I am currently a reseach engineering intern at <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://semmle.com/">Semmle</a></span>, where I am working on the JavaScript analysis package of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://github.com/Semmle/ql/">QL</a></span> language.

During the year, I'm a PhD student at Northeastern University, where I'm a part of the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Programming Languages lab</a></span> working with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.franktip.org/">Frank Tip</a></span>. 
My PhD work so far has been focused on static analysis of asynchronous JavaScript code.

Prior to this, I did my masters at the University of Waterloo in the <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">Programming Languages group</a></span>, where I worked with my advisor <span style="color:blue"><a href="http://the.gregor.institute/">Gregor Richards</a></span> on a technique for fast gradual typing using the virtual machine.
My undergraduate was at Laurentian University, where my research was in computational ecology, in fruit fly population modelling (there was a time where I didn't work on programming languages!).

Feel free to email me.
