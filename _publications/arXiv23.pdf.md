Large-scale static analysis of JavaScript code and development of statistical model to automatically determine incorrect property accesses in clients of popular event-driven APIs.
This is a generalization of the approach presented for finding dead listener registrations.
Included in this approach is a second-stage context-sensitive analysis that runs on clients to filter out and identify false/true positives of the bug patterns in a particular code base.
