Tool for automating the mining of dynamic information from npm packages and/or GitHub projects (in JavaScript/TypeScript).
In particular, it automates the mining of install/build instructions, test suite execution, number of passing/failing tests, etc.
It also allows users to run custom scripts or static analyses in CodeQL over the source code of the packages.
